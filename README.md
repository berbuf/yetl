ETL as Yaml
#
##### Control a full ETL code with domain constraints, complex aggregations and quality checkpoints as a configuration file
#
##### Remove and track down data that fail to pass constraints  
#
##### Add your custom constraints and transformations as simply as adding a function in a file and a line in a yaml
